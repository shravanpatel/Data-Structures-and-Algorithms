Stack is an Abstract Data Type that serves as a collection of elements. It follows Last In First Out order to access the elements from stack.

Ways to Implement:
1. Array 
2. Linked List

The time complexity of operational methods to access elements is.

Data Structure of Stack		Operation		Time Complexity
Array or Linked List		Accessing		O(n)
				Insertion		O(1)
				Deletion		O(1)
