Huffmans’s Coding Algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm 

Ways to Implement:
1. Adjacency List – Priority Queue 

The time complexity of Kruskal’s algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight.

Data Structure of Graph		Ordering		Time Complexity
Adjacency List			Priority Queue 		O(n log(n))
