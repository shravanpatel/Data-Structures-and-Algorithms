Prim’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree is an algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

Ways to Implement:
1. Adjacency Matrix – Searching
2. Adjacency List – Binary Heap
3. Adjacency List – Priority Queue with decrease key
4. Adjacency List – Priority Queue without decrease key

The time complexity of Prim’s algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight.

Data Structure of Graph		Ordering					Time Complexity
Adjacency Matrix		Searching					O(|V|2)
Adjacency List			Binary Heap					O(|E|log|V|)
Adjacency List			Priority Queue with decrease key		O(|E|2log|V|)
Adjacency List			Priority Queue without decrease key 		O(|E|log|V|)
