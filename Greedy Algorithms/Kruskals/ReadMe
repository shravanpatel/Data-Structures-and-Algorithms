Kruskal’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree is an algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.

Ways to Implement:
1. Adjacency List – Priority Queue 

The time complexity of Kruskal’s algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight.

Data Structure of Graph		Ordering		Time Complexity
Adjacency List			Priority Queue 		O(|E|2log|V|)
