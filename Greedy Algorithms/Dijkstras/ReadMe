Dijkstra’s Algorithm or Shortest Path First Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted undirected graph.

Ways to Implement:
1. Adjacency Matrix – Searching
2. Adjacency List – Binary Heap
3. Adjacency List – Priority Queue
4. Adjacency List – TreeMap and Pair class

The time complexity of Dijkstra algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight.

Data Structure of Graph		Ordering		Time Complexity
Adjacency Matrix		Searching		O(|V|2)
Adjacency List			Binary Heap		O(|E|log|V|)
Adjacency List			Priority Queue		O(|E|log|V|)
Adjacency List			TreeMap			O(|E|log|V|)
